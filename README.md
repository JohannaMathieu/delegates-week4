Loops & nested loops

NESTED

for(let i = 0; i < .length; i++){
for(let j = 0; j < [i].length; j++){
console.log( [i][j])
}
}

MAP

Map requires a new variable, it will create a new array using a previous one - call the 1st variable then add ".map" - from there you can call an arrow function ( => );

ForEach

Is used to work on every element in the array, it will not generate a new array as of "map".

To make it work use ".forEach (() => () );"

Filter

Fill create a new array if the condition passes
